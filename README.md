# Battleships

## Project Overview
Battleships is a classic game where players try to sink each other's fleet of ships by guessing the locations of the ships on a grid. This project implements the game using [mention the language or framework if applicable], allowing a user to play against an opponent [specify AI, another player, etc.].

## Features
- **Grid-based gameplay**: Players select coordinates on a grid to attack enemy ships.
- **Multiple ship types**: Different ships with varying sizes (e.g., Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser).
- **Turn-based mechanics**: Players alternate turns guessing the location of enemy ships.
- **[Any additional feature like scoring, custom grid size, difficulty levels, etc.]**

## How to Play
1. **Game Setup**: Each player places their fleet of ships on their grid.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns guessing the coordinates of the opponent's ships.
3. **Hit or Miss**: If the guessed coordinate contains a part of a ship, it is marked as a hit, otherwise, it's a miss.
4. **Winning**: The game ends when all of a player's ships are sunk.
